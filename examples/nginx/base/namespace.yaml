# Namespaces in Kubernetes provide a scope for names and help organize resources.
# They are useful for:
# - Separating resources between different teams or projects
# - Managing access control and resource quotas
# - Organizing resources in a logical way
#
# This namespace will contain all resources for our Nginx demo application.
# It's a good practice to create a dedicated namespace for each application
# rather than using the default namespace.
