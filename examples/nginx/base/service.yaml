# Services in Kubernetes provide stable network endpoints for pods.
# They enable:
# - Service discovery within the cluster
# - Load balancing across multiple pods
# - Decoupling of frontend and backend services
#
# This service:
# - Exposes the Nginx deployment on port 80
# - Uses ClusterIP type (default) for internal cluster access
# - Selects pods using the 'app: nginx' label
#
# Key components:
# - spec.selector: Matches pods to expose (must match pod labels)
# - spec.ports: Defines the ports to expose
# - spec.type: ClusterIP (internal), NodePort, or LoadBalancer
