# Ingress in Kubernetes manages external access to services.
# It provides:
# - HTTP/HTTPS routing rules
# - SSL/TLS termination
# - Name-based virtual hosting
#
# This ingress:
# - Routes traffic from nginx.local to the nginx service
# - Uses Traefik as the ingress controller (default in K3s)
# - Provides external access to the Nginx application
#
# Key components:
# - spec.rules: Defines routing rules based on host/path
# - spec.rules[].http.paths: Maps paths to services
# - spec.rules[].host: The domain name to match
